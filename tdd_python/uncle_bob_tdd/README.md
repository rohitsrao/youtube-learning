### Test Driven Development - Uncle Bob

Three Rules of Test Driven Development

1. You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written
a test that fails because the production code does not exist

2. You are not allowed to write more of a test than is sufficient to fail and not
compiling is failing. 

3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass
the currently failing test
