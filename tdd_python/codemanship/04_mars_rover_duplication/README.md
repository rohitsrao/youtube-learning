Learning
--------

1. Eliminating duplication lends itself to figuring out generalisations 
and abstractions in our code. The design emerges from elimnating duplication

2. There is a danger in refactoring duplciation too early and that is 
that we end up introducing a wrong abstraction

3. The Rule of Three is a guideline that on average wait to see at least 3 duplications
before refactoring the code

4. Naturally the longer you wait to refactor the more time it takes to refactor

5. Test code needs to be maintained just like source code
